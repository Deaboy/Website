Technology, where I plan to graduate with a bachelors degree of computer science
in May, 2016 and immediately begin working in software or game development.

# Personal Information

I am good at math, am a fast learner, can pick up on new programming languages
and standards quickly, and am a stickler for the proper usage of the word
"literally". I can easily adapt to design patterns as well as programming
paradigms and am perpetually learning the technologies and techniques employed
in the software development, UX design, and games industries.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing and creating video games, creating YouTube
videos, and learning more about the ever-changing technology industry. I love
spending time with friends who enjoy similar things as I do. My career goals are
to go into mobile application design and development, desktop application design
and development, or game design and development. My ultimate personal goal with
technology is to create applications that make people’s lives better.
