# Personal Website Design Notes
===============================

## Database info
- database: 'me'
- database user: 'me'@'localhost'
- database user password: 'password'

## CMS Design Notes
- database-driven
- simple as possible
- api for developers...maybe
- start with users and designers
- expand to developers later on
- priority is to build on the engine
- worry about extensions MUCH later

- markdown-formatted content
- allow PHP-preprocessed content

## Workflow
- pages-based
- pages have parents
- pages have drop-down type selection
- default behavior: pages have typed-out content (markdown)
- pages define structure
- preprocessed with PHP, then formatted with markdown
- PHP processing and markdown formatting are options

- snippets
- - formatted content or PHP code
- - can be inserted anywhere

## Still to design
- non-markdown-formatted content
- ajax support
- extendability (blogs/store/gallery)
